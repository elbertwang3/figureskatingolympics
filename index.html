  			<p class="paragraph"> The 2018 Winter Olympics are almost upon us. (In)arguably, figure skating is <i>the</i> marquee sport of the Winter Games, and the ladies' competition is the main event. With the recent release of the Tonya Harding biopic <i> I, Tonya</i>, which chronicles an event that took place 20 years prior in the sport, figure skating is very much a part of our cultural consciousness. In the 90s, figure skating was at its heyday in America, featuring stars including Kristi Yamaguchi, Nancy Kerrigan, Tara Lipinski, and Michelle Kwan. The television ratings reflected this too--over 120 million Americans tuned into the ladies' event at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, watching the drama between Kerrigan and Harding unfold on ice. But following the judging scandal at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, judging became less accessible to the average viewer, and with no American man or woman as the face of the sport, interest waned. </p>

  			<p class="paragraph"> At these Olympics, the country will rest its gold medal hopes in figure skating on 18-year-old Nathan Chen. Chen has been a trailblazer in the sport, as the first man to land five different quadruple jumps in competition. At the 2014 Sochi Games, the winner Yuzuru Hanyu only successfully landed the quad type of quad--the toe loop--on his way to the gold. Since then, the sport has evolved, and any medal contender will need an arsenal of at least two different quads. For the casual viewer, all six jumps may look the same, so I've provided a primer on how to tell each jump apart.</p>

  			<div class="jump-diagram">
  				<h2>Identifying the Jumps</h2>
  				<p class="paragraph"> The two main distinguishing factors are whether the jump is a toe or edge jump and whether it has a forward or backward takeoff. The axel is the easiest to tell apart because it is the only jump with a forward takeoff. The toe loop, flip, and lutz are toe jumps, meaning the skater uses the toe pick at the front of the skate to launch themselves upward, and the salchow, loop, and axel are edge jumps, meaning the skater uses the edge of the skate and a knee bend to generate height.</p>
  				<p class="paragraph"> The jump descriptions below assume that the skater jumps in a counter-clockwise direction, as most skaters jump counter-clockwise. For clockwise jumps, the takeoff and landings are on the opposite feet. </p>

  				<p class="paragraph"> The Axel, Salchow, and Lutz are all named after their respective inventors. The other jumps have more unclear origins. Below is a timeline of the first man or woman to land each type of jump. In some instances, I could not find any footage of a skater, and in the case that I could not find footage of the skater performing their specific jump, I've shown a video that features their skating.

	  				<h2>Who's Jumping What?</h2>
	  				<p class="paragraph">I've compiled a list of 18 skaters, 9 men and 9 women, who will be the likely medal contenders at these Games. Each skater's jump layout for both programs is depicted below, an approximate composite of what they've performed this season. The size of the circles reflects the point value for each jump, while the color of the circles reflects how well the jump has been executed this season.</p>

	  			</div>

	  			<div class="jumpsmen">
	  				<h4> The Men </h4>
	  				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 2rem"> At these Olympics, the men will be performing quads and more quads. It's a risky move, but in the last quadrennial (pun intended), the men have pushed the athleticism of the sport forward more than ever. At the 2010 Vancouver Games, American Evan Lysacek won the gold medal in the men's event without attempting a single quad, to which silver medalist Russian Evgeny Plushenko cried foul. Americans Jason Brown and Adam Rippon both have beautiful programs, but neither have landed a clean quad in competition yet. It will not be enough. Lysacek might just be the last man to win a World or Olympic title without a quad. </p>

	  			</div>
	  			<div class="jumpswomen">
	  				<h4> The Women </h4>
	  				<p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 2rem"> Three Olympics ago at the 2006 Turin Games, no woman landed a triple-triple combination in the short program. At these Games, a clean triple-triple will be essential part of every program. The most likely medal contenders will complete two triple-triples in the free skate. In order to maximize points, some skaters, particularly the Russians, have chosen to "backload" their programs, performing most or all of their jumps in the second half their programs, incurring a 10% bonus for those jumps. While the men's event is a battle of who completes the most quads, the women's event will be a matter of who skates the most cleanly. Grades of execution will make all of the difference.</p>

	  		<div class="wrprogressiondiv">
	  			<h2>World Record Progression under the new judging system</h2>
	  			<p class="paragraph"> Under the new judging system established in 2004, each element performed is assigned a base value and a grade of execution. Since 2004, skaters have continually pushed the athleticism of the sport, moving the world record ever upward. Over time, they've performed harder jumps, performed them better, and performed them in the second half of their programs.</p>
	  			 <p class="paragraph">Below, I've visualized the all of the medalists of the Grand Prix Final, World Championships, and Olympic Games under the new judging system. Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu and Russia's Evgenia Medvedeva currently hold the world records for the men's and women's events respectively. </p>
	  			<div class="wrprogression">
	  			</div>
	  			<p class="paragraph"> While the increased athleticism of figure skating legitimizes it as a sport, it comes at a cost: the artistic component, which comprises half of the total score for each program. "Figure skating is 50% sport and 50% art," says legendary coach Marina Zueva, but that ratio is gradually leaning toward the former. Since quadruple jumps are worth so much that even a fall on one is worth more than a triple, skaters are willing to take that risk to attempt more of them. In gymnastics, the deduction from a fall is impossible to recover from, but in figure skating, it's possible to win a medal with <i>multiple</i> falls, like the bloodbath of the men's event at the 2014 Sochi Games. In the women's event, skaters have increasingly begun to backload their programs, putting all of their jumps in the second half for the bonus. This makes for a poor program composition, but judges aren't punishing them for it in the program components score either.</p>

	  			 <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 4rem">As viewers, it's difficult to reconcile wanting to feel the satisfaction of watching a clean, artistically nuanced, and well-balanced program with wanting to see skaters perform the big jumps--it's hard to have both. At these Winter Games, we can hope that the winners will skate clean and marry both the athletic and artistic aspects of the sport, the reason figure skating has always been the main event of the Winter Games.</p>
